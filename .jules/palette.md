## 2026-06-29 - Missing Focus States on Interactive Icon Buttons
**Learning:** Custom interactive icon components in this app (e.g., HeartButton, NotificationBell, SidebarModal close button) frequently omit focus states despite having hover animations, negatively impacting keyboard accessibility.
**Action:** Ensure that all newly created or modified interactive elements, especially icon-only buttons without default browser styles, include explicit `focus-visible` utility classes (e.g., `focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-primary focus-visible:outline-offset-2`).

## 2024-05-24 - Consistent Keyboard Focus Indicators
**Learning:** While checking accessibility on key interactive elements (e.g., custom icon buttons, game card triggers), I found that many had hover states but lacked visible focus indicators for keyboard users. Adding a consistent focus ring pattern greatly improves accessibility without compromising the design.
**Action:** Always apply `focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-primary focus-visible:outline-offset-2` (or similar utility classes from the established design system) to all interactive elements (`button`, `a`, `input`, etc.) to ensure keyboard navigability.
## 2026-08-05 - Added accessible names to conditionally hidden text
**Learning:** When using Tailwind utility classes like `max-lg:hidden` to hide text inside an interactive element based on screen size, the element can lose its accessible name for screen readers on breakpoints where the text is not rendered in the DOM.
**Action:** Always ensure such elements include an `aria-label` attribute to provide a consistent accessible name regardless of the active responsive breakpoint, maintaining accessibility without compromising the visual design.
